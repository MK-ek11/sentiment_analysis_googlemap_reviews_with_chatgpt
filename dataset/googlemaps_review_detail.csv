He had no idea about how to read the order and doubt the customers.
After realizing he is wrong, he walked away without apologizing.

He definitely owe me an apology and I think the presence of such type of person will only ruin the reputation of the starbucks in HKU.

these days I purchased the bakery products from starbucks app, i waited for more than ten mins still the staffs in HKU didn't start making them.
