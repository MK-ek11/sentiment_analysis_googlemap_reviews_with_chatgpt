# Starbucks Customer Satisfaction and Sentiment Analysis based on Googlemap Reviews
### Goal:
- Google Maps API was used to automate the extraction of the Google Maps hyperlink for each Starbucks location
- Selenium and BeautifulSoup were used to scrape the Google Maps webpage
- OpenAI API chatgpt model for customer review sentiment analysis

### Steps:
1. Google Maps API was used to automate the extraction of the Google Maps hyperlink for each Starbucks location <br>
2. Selenium and BeautifulSoup were used to scrape the Google Maps webpage <br>
    2.1 Before scraping the reviews, the analysis was narrowed down to only the Starbucks location in the western district of Hong Kong Island <br> 
    2.2. Data extracted included review ratings, reviewer's data, and review content.<br>
3. GPT-3.5-turbo model through OpenAI API was used for sentiment analysis <br>
4. Data analysis was carried out on Starbucks Review Ratings, Starbucks Review Sentiment and Emotions Expressed in Customerâ€™s Reviews 

### Conclusion:
The insights drawn from this project suggest that while review ratings can be a useful indicator, analyzing the review content provides a more nuanced understanding of customer sentiment and experiences. Additionally, the variance in customer experiences across different locations highlights the need for location-specific analysis and improvements. By identifying specific emotions expressed in the reviews, it may be possible to better understand the underlying experiences and address issues that contribute to negative emotions.
